## 題目

A builder is looking to build a row of `N` houses that can be of `K` different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an `N` by `K` matrix where the $n^{\text{th}}$ row and $k^{\text{th}}$ column represents the cost to build the $n^{\text{th}}$ house with $k^{\text{th}}$ color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
